            <h4>Ques-1: What are the differences between local storage and session storage ?</h4>
            <h5>Ans: The differences are that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and
            assigned to that particular tab.</h5>

            <h4>Ques-2: What are the differences between global scope and block scope ?</h4>
            <h5>Ans: The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable. Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else.</h5>

            <h4>Ques-3: How does work event loop in javascript ?</h4>
            <h5>Ans: The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.</h5>

            <h4>Ques-4: How do we get undefined in javascript ?</h4>
            <h5>Ans: undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial value of undefined is the primitive value undefined In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.</h5>
